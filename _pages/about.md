I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alabama since 2022. I graduatd from University of Louisville with my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering in 2022, focusing on transportation and operations research. My main research interests include algorithm design, operations research, and predictive modeling.

I have been working at the University of Alabama across several sectors, such as the Institute of Data Analytics, the Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, Alabama Mobility Power Center, and Alabama Transportation Institute.
